Techniques for data structures and algorithms are Windowed approach and two pointers
Windowed approach can use for or while loops while two pointers usualy uses while loops

Techniques for linked lists are runners. Runners are used to find cycles. If at any point the two pointers or runners equal the smae node then you have a cycle.

Python String Methods to solve DSA include
.isalnum()
.lower()
.split()
.upper()
.join()

reverse an array with arr[::-1]
.pop()
.append()
max()
min()

abs()

DS - Linked Lists, Tree/Trie/Graph, Arrays/Strings/Matrices, Heaps, Stacks and Queues, Hash Maps (dictionaries)
Algorithms - Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search
Concepts - Bit maniulation, Math and Logic, Recursion, Memory (heaps vs stacks), Big O Time and Space Complexity, Dynamic Programming

Bit manipulation - ~, &, |, ^, <<, >>

def set_bit(num, i):
  return num | ~(1 << i)

set_bit(9,0) => ( 1001 | 0010 ) = 1011 = 11
