CTCI 6.2 Basketball

You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot ot make the hoop
Game 2: You get three shots and you hae to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making aparticular shot, for which values of p chould you puck one game or the other?

The probability of game 1 is 50-50 you make it or you dont
The probability of game 2 is less than 33% because you have to make 2 shots of out 3 and the chance is 50-50
if you have 3 50-50 shots at the chance and you make it half the time your luck is 1.5 shots to make out of 3.

if p is the probability you would want a probability of 51-49% for game one. Make-Miss ratio
if p is the probability for game 2 you would need a 66% chance of making the shot. This is a guess

66%-66%-66% 2 out of 3 times you are going to make it based on probability but this could be wrong.

Answer is game 1 if 0 < p < .5 and game two is 0.5 < p < 1
