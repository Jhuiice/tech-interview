CTCI 6.3 Dominos

an 8 by 8 chessboard is used and we are given 31 dominos. Each domino can cover 2 squares. The opposite corners of the board are cut off on 1 diagnol. Can the board be entirely covered by dominos with the corners missing? Can you use 31 dominos to cover the entire board?

On this board. Is there a formula.
The amount of squares is 8 x 8 - 2 = 62
The amount of the board the dominos can cover is 2 x 31 = 62 so all dominos can cover the board if we could seperate them into 1x1 blocks.

With the board being cut off at the corner we must lay one domino sideways making the next column an odd amount meaning we have to lay one domino on the next row sideways making the next one odd until we get to the last column where the number of tiles will be even with 6 tiles or 3 dominos to use. If this logic checks out than this will be proven right.
One issue to the above. Since the corners are cut off than when we get to the last column we have one tile left.
Can we switch the domino which we lay sideways in the middle of the tiles board?
We cannot. The issue is we cannot do this because any change of dominos in the outer rows will create odd number of tiles in the next row until we get to the last row and cannot connect in the appropriate order. Even if we switch one of the dominos in the second to last column to try and make the next column not hit the missing edge we wont be able to complete the column we switch the domino in.

This is not possible.
