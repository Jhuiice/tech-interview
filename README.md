NOTE: None of the coding challenges are mine.

To learn and advance my career as a software developer. I love learning, solving problems and creating intuitve projects for self pleasure. I have been on my journey for two years now, and have taken a few breaks here and there because I did not know the correct direction to head into as a self taught developer. The time is now to execute and become the best version of myself. Becoming a software developer is the next step for my life.

The Algorithms, Data Structures, and Concepts I am using are from the CTCI book.

Project Ideas along learning.

3rd party service to render digital goods as NFTs to show proof of ownership to seller company. This can help people show they have the ownership of their digital assets for any technical issues they have as a buyer.

A website with Specific NFT login access for pay wall features.
